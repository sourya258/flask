                                    is really good, there are certain modes like signature sound, balance mode and beast
                                    mode. You can differentiate between signature sound and balance mode as certain
                                    changes are noticable but I couldn't find any significant difference in beast mode.
                                    Next about it's design, it's very well but buds tend to fall off after some

Expecting the inclusion of spatial sound through some updates. Manual power on-off is missing. It's a major drawback. Once the battery of the case is over, the buds will not be turned on even though those have full charge. You need to connect the case with the charger, and then only you will be able to connect the buds."
